# EdInvest
```
This is the EdInvest project made by Toma Lovre and Jan for dump's internship cup
As you might be able to see by commit times it was very fun
So here are the development instructions
In the Edinvest folder (the api folder) you will find the .sln file which you will use to open the project in your IDE
Then in the application.json file change the connection string so it suits your system
After that open either powershell or package manager console, choose Data as the base project and type the following:
(in PCM)

Update-Database

Then run the backend as IIS server (important cause of port number)
After you run the backend, open the project in vs code
in the root directory of the project run

cd ./frontend
npm install
npm start

After that the app should be running fine

As in terms of content made, the team is satisfied with the amount we did but of course there can always be improvements
In case any problems occur contact any of the contributors
(P.S. After this project I certainly do not reccommend using generic services)
